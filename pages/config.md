Polychromatic's uses JSON to store its data. The location is based on
the XDG spec, which is usually:

    ~/.config/polychromatic/
    ~/.cache/polychromatic/

Preferences can be changed via the Controller's **Edit â†’ Preferences**.

{% include img-2x.html alt="Preferences is accessible via the Edit menu bar" src="/images/preferences.png" %}

You can manually edit the JSON files based on the specifications below. Note that
changes take effect on the next launch and invalid syntax will cause the file to
be reinitialised (appending `.bak` to the file name)

It is usually necessary to restart the application (or editor windows)
for new preferences to take effect.

### Software Updates

When major changes happen to the application that affects save data, the next run
under the new version will automatically update its configuration.
Old versions will be copied to a separate file or folder.

As a result, downgrading the software isn't supported without first restoring the old
save data manually.
