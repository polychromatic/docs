## Types of Effects

### Sequence

Currently, these are built in the form of pixels and frames. Use them to highlight
specific keys for your applications/games or create an animated ambience.

This type of effect can only be run on other hardware if they have matching
dimensions.

> **In future:** Polychromatic will expand the types of effects.

## File Management

You can create, play, delete, clone or edit effects you have defined.
Effects can only be created when compatible hardware is present, so metadata can
be retrieved.

## Editor Tools

The tools at your disposal allow you to build digital art. There are:

* 5 light/dark variants of each of your saved colours.
* Buttons to click/scroll over to change the hue, saturation and lightness.
* Options to "Shift LEDs" everything left, right, up or down.
  * Available from the **Edit** menu.

For maximum productivity, try the keyboard shortcuts!

## Device Graphic vs Grid

While in the editor, you have a choice to use the matrix directly (in the form
of grid) or with an accompanying graphic (if available).

To learn more on creating/editing these graphics, see [Device Maps & Graphics](/devicemaps/).
